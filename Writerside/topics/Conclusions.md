# Conclusions

In this section we will summarize our insights and findings from the development of the project. We will also 
discuss the limitations of our project and suggest possible future work.

## Francesco Magnani

This project has helped me to understand the importance of a good software architecture, particularly from the point 
of view of the two extremes of the spectrum: 
- the high-level architecture, referring to the first stages and the first design decisions of the project, starting 
from a solid model of the domain and the requirements of the system;
- the pure practical implementation and the software development process itself, which allows developers to become
free when performing changes on the software, without the fear of breaking the system. This is achieved by constructing
a good automation and testing infrastructure, through various tools and practices (e.g. CI/CD, build automation etc.).

This two aspects lead to a more solid and maintainable software, and this project has been a great opportunity to 
experience this first-hand. 

There are still many aspects that could be improved in the project, such as the implementation of a more complex 
authentication system, the addition of more features to the application, and the improvement of the user interface.
Also, regarding the deployment of the application, it would be interesting to explore the possibility of deploying the
application on a cloud platform, such as AWS or Azure, and to implement a more complex CI/CD pipeline that includes
this aspect.

Finally, it would be interesting to integrate even more different platforms and work with a bigger team, to experience
the challenges of team coordination and the integration of different parts of the system when working with a larger
codebase.
